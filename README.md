# Euler Project

https://projecteuler.net/

*10 problems solved for now.*

## Rules
For those who haven't previously heard of the Euler Project, it's a wonderful website where you can find more than 600 math problems. The aim is to solve them using your mathematical and computational skills.

For those, like me, who didn't study STEM beyond high school, it's also an amazing place to have fun with math and python.

The rules are very clear : you are not allowed to share the solutions. But I have an other file where I elaborated a toolbox which can be used independantly, and you are welcome to open it and use it as you wish.

Of course, the main goal of all this is to encourage you to create your own, and to join the exciting adventure of resolving enigmas on the Euler Project.

The Code Week may finish today, but coding days are not over : enjoy !
