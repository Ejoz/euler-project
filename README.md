# Euler Project

## Rules
For those who don't know anything about the Euler Project, it's a wonderful website where you can find more than 600 mathematic problems.
You have to solve them with mathematical principles and programming skills.

For those like me, who didn't have the chance to attend STEM studies, it's an amazing occasion to have fun with maths and python.

The rules are very clear : you are not allowed to share the solutions. But I have an other file where I elaborated a toolbox which can be used independantly, and you are welcome to open it and use it as you wish.

Of course, the main goal of all this is to encourage you to create your own, and to join the exciting adventure of resolving enigmas on the Euler Project.

The Code Week may finish today, but coding days are not over : enjoy !
